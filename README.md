# Junk Robot Simulator

This repository is written by Chevy Ng Zhi Wei of University College London.
The purpose of the repository is to create a robot simulator which works with the junk robot that was created as part of Chevy Individual Final Year Project.

The code was written using Angular2 and not Angular4
The code may not work in an Angular4 environment due to certain dependencies


## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.

<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.

**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

## Running the repository

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `junk-robot`).
```shell

Open project folder in text editor of choice of use. I used [Atom](https://atom.io/) because it's awesome and free!

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
